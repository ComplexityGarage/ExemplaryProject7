# Description of the project 
The project presents an operon - a construct in biology responsible for occurance of specific features in microorganisms like bacteria. The operon consists of several genes (4 in this project) which are expressed when the activator binds to the promoter after being activated by the inducer. Genes expression is shown by the color of the LEDs. When they are red - expression is not taking place, and when they turn green - the expression is activated. The model may be used as a tool to better understand the mechanism of gene expression in the operon.
